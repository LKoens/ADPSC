# Asymptotic flow around doubly periodic array of slender-cylinders
MatLab programs providing asympotitc flow determined in "The slow viscous flow around doubly-periodic arrays of infinite slender cylinders" paper
Asymptotic form was determined using a representation by fundamental singularities and expanding in small radius.
Results are accurate for cylinder diameters less than or equal to 0.2 of all other lengths.
Singularities are represented in rapidly converging series forms.
